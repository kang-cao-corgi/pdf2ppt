# PDF to PPT Converter
## Ideas
PDF files generated by Mac Keynote usually have glitches(font, position etc.) when converted to Microsoft ppt slides directly.
This app aims to convert pdf pages to images then insert them as ppt slides.

## Download
you can download the executable from releases [here](https://github.com/kang-cao-corgi/pdf2ppt/releases/)

## Development
### prerequisites
- python <3.13,>=3.8
- dependency manager [python-poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- poppler
    ```bash
    brew install poppler
    ```
    NOTE: on windows please follow [here](https://pdf2image.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#windows), especially if you want to pack with pyinstaller

    verify installation:
    ```bash
    pdftoppm -h
    ```

### setup python env
```bash
poetry install
```

### packaging
prepare your own spec
```bash
pyinstaller --name=pdf2ppt --onefile main.py --noconsole
```
add additional dependencies and binaries to .spec file
```
datas=[
    ('/path/to/pdftoppm/binaries/*', 'poppler/'),
    ('/path/to/pptx/templates/default.pptx', 'pptx/templates')
]
```
NOTE: you may need to modify `def get_poppler_path()` to point to your own `pdftoppm` executable. You can use pyinstaller option `--onedir` to resolve problem "Where is my file?"


```bash
pyinstaller pdf2ppt.spec
```
